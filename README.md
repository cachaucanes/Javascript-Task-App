# Javascript-Task-App
**TaskApp** is a simple task management application built with HTML, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. It allows users to create and manage tasks that persist across page reloads using localStorage.

- Task Persistence: Tasks are stored in localStorage, making them available even after refreshing the page.
- Task Management: Each task can be removed individually through a delete button.

1.  **Left Section**: Contains the task creation form with fields for entering the task title and description.
2.  **Right Section**: Displays a list of all tasks with an option to delete any of them.
